# Liam's Digital Playground 🚀 | Personal Portfolio Website V1.2

Welcome to my digital playground! This isn't just a website; it's a living showcase of my journey, the skills I'm passionate about, and the projects that bring my code to life as a self-taught developer. Crafted with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**, it's designed to be a modern, responsive, and interactive experience.

## 🛠️ Get It Running (Local Setup)

Want to peek behind the curtains or tweak things yourself? It's super easy to get this project rolling locally:

1.  **Clone this repository to your machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Liam208/liam-portfolio.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd portfolio
    ```

3.  **Open in your browser:**
    Simply open the `public/index.html` file in your favorite web browser. All the magic (CSS, JS, images, icons, Bootstrap) is self-contained within the `public` folder!

## 🌐 Tech Stack Spotlight

Here's what powers this portfolio:

* **HTML5:** The sturdy skeleton that structures all the awesome content. 🦴

* **CSS3:** Bringing style, flair, and stunning visuals to every pixel. 🎨 (Custom styles are in `public/css/index.css`!)

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Making everything interactive, dynamic, and smooth! ✨ (Interactive features are in `public/js/index.js`.)

* **Bootstrap 5:** For that slick, responsive design and robust components that look great everywhere. 📱💻

## 🔥 Key Features That Shine

* **Responsive & Adaptive Design:** Looks fantastic on any device, from a tiny phone to a huge desktop monitor. Your portfolio, everywhere!

* **Intelligent Light/Dark Theme Toggle:** Click a button, and the whole site transforms! Your preference is even remembered for your next visit – pretty neat, huh? 🌓

* **Dynamic Typing Animation:** A fun little intro that types out my interests in real-time. ✍️

## More to come
